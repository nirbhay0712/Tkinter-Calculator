💡 How It Works  

The calculator uses Python’s built-in tkinter module to render buttons and handle GUI interactions. Each operation (like +, -, 1/x, etc.) is handled by its own function, and the input is managed through a single Entry widget.

Global variables are used to store the state between number entries and operation selection.
